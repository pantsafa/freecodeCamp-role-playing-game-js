# freecodeCamp-role-playing-game-js
This is one of the freeCodeCamp project which I have to complete while learning javaScript where  I will learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding a Role Playing Game. I will learn how to work with arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more from this project.

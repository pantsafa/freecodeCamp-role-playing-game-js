# freecodeCamp-role-playing-game-js
This is one of the freeCodeCamp project which I have to complete while learning javaScript where  will learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding your own Role Playing Game. You'll learn how to work with arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.
